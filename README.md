### 1️⃣ Hand-crafted Engineering Projects
Projects I built myself, fully from scratch:

- **[TeamBuilder](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/TeamBuilder)**  
  𝚿🧠👩🏻‍⚕️👥🤝 Whether you're a team psychologist bringing people together, a dungeon master tracking a campaign, or straight-up Nick Fury trying keeping Avengers united, TeamBuilder got you covered. 

- **[Signed-8-bit-Calculator-With-Fundamental-Operations](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/Signed-8-bit-Calculator-With-Fundamental-Operations)**  
  🧩👨‍💻🧮⚡🖥️ Hardware-level signed 8-bit calculator - built in VHDL, for the Nexys A7. Basically a real calculator, but in code. 

- **[CNP-Validator-In-Assembly](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/CNP-Validator-In-Assembly)**  
  🔍🗂️💾✅🏛️ Pure Assembly MS-DOS tool to check CNPs (Romanian SSN). Runs on 16-bit processors, without employing higher level functions or external libraries 

- **[TreeProcessExplorer](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/TreeProcessExplorer)**  
  🌳⚙️🔄🔍🛡️ A process explorer that displays all active processes in a visual multi-way tree hierarchy. It's made in pure C and uses the **Raylib** library for the visual representation. 

- **[Intercom-System](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/Intercom-System)**  
  🏠🔒🔑📞🔊 A hardware Intercom system that secures the entry to your estate. Access is done via RFID Card or from inside confirmation. An LCD screen offers clear feedback on current state.

### 2️⃣ Experimental Vibe-Coded Projects
Projects made with the help of LLMs and AI-assisted development, as past time activities:

- **[A.I.-reply-arena](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/A.I.-reply-arena)**  
  🧙‍♂️📜🔮🤖✨Got a question and don't know which A.I. to ask? Ask them all! And then, pick the winner. A full-stack solution that calls several AI api's at once. 
  
- **[SameSong](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/SameSong)**  
  🔬🎼⚡️🤖📡 An audio matching software designed to identify songs from short clips of sound. Using a dual-perspective approach of FFT fingerprinting and CLAP vectors, it delivers the exact timestamped matches and "vibe" similarities. 
  
- **[Your-own-GPT](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/Your-own-GPT)**  
  💬🤖✨🔮💻 A SLM that runs on your computer using a single Python file. This is meant to be an introduction to building large language models 

- **[Stay-Locked-In](https://github.com/DariusSasarman/Stay-Locked-in)**  
  ⛓️🔒⏳🌐⛔A meme browser plugin made for Firefox that lets you choose what pages are distracting you from doing your work and helps you stop them
